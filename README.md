- 👋 Hi, I’m Liki, I code all kinds of stuff, lately I coded a package for OpenTTD and started learning webdev.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript.
- 💞️ I’m not really looking for a collaboration, but if you have tips to improve my coding skills, be sure to let me know.
- 📫 You can reach me through github.

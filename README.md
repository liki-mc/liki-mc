- 👋 Hi, I’m Liki, I code plugins for minecraft, specifically for the brickSMP server.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java, spigot, and trying to understand the difference with craftbukkit.
- 💞️ I’m not really looking for a collaboration, but if you have tips to improve my coding skills, be sure to let me know.
- 📫 You can reach me through github.
